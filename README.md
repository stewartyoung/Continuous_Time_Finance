# projects
Hi Everyone!

My name is Stewart and this repository will act as a log of my personal projects. I'm an Actuarial Science student, and I enjoy a range of topics such as Statistics, Machine Learning, Finance, Modelling, Economics and reallly just about anything with Maths involved!!! 

I hope to share what I have learned in my studies thus far and hopefully you find some of it useful! I understand Actuarial Science is a fairly niche subject so if you have anything you'd like to see in particular please let me know :)
